    content: 'I just finished reading "The Haunting of Thornfield Manor" and I\'m convinced the narrator has been lying to us the entire time. The inconsistencies in the timeline, the way certain events are described... Has anyone else noticed this? What if the ghost was never real and it was all in their mind?',

    content: 'I\'ve been thinking about the portrait scene and I believe it\'s the key to understanding the protagonist\'s entire arc. The way the eyes "follow" them represents their guilt and inability to escape their past. The smile at the end? That\'s acceptance. What do you all think?',
