## Synopsis

A modern horror tale about ChloeVlogs, a YouTuber with 2.3 million subscribers who dies during a livestream from a haunted asylum. The video goes viral, accumulating hundreds of millions of views. But the horror doesn't end with her death—the video can't be deleted, keeps re-uploading itself, and viewers start seeing themselves in the footage.

### Page 1: The Viral Death
ChloeVlogs dies during a livestream. The video goes viral instantly—20M, 50M, 100M views. The algorithm loves it.

### Page 2: The Setup
It was a 24-hour challenge: "Spending the Night in a REAL Haunted Asylum! (GONE WRONG)". Classic clickbait thumbnail with "NOT CLICKBAIT!!!" in the title.

### Page 3: The Change
At 3:33 AM, something shifts. Chloe senses a presence—"Someone who wants to be seen." The livestream continues.

### Page 4: The Figure
Viewers notice something in the background. A figure moving closer, frame by frame, looking directly at the camera. At the viewers.

### Page 5: The Disappearance
At 4:17 AM, Chloe screams. Camera drops. When it returns, she's gone. The figure is now clear, smiling, looking down at the phone. At us.

### Page 6: The Spread
The video can't be deleted. Comments flood in: "I saw it in my room." "It's watching me through my screen." "I can't stop watching."

### Page 7: The Discovery
Police find Chloe's body three days later. Cardiac arrest. Eyes frozen in that perfect thumbnail expression. Phone still recording. 500 million views.

### Page 8: The Algorithm
The video is still up. Can't be removed—it re-uploads itself. If you watch at 3:33 AM, you'll see yourself in the background. The algorithm only cares about engagement. And death gets views.

## Themes

- **Digital Horror**: Technology as a conduit for supernatural evil
- **Viral Content**: The dark side of internet fame and engagement
- **The Algorithm**: AI/algorithms as indifferent, inhuman forces
- **Clickbait Culture**: Exploitation for views taken to its darkest conclusion
- **Modern Paranoia**: Screens, cameras, and constant surveillance
- **Immortality Through Content**: Death doesn't end your digital presence

## Why This Works

1. **Relevant**: Speaks to modern fears about social media, algorithms, and viral content
2. **Believable**: Feels like it could actually happen in our digital age
3. **Layered Horror**: Multiple levels—the death, the spread, the inability to stop it
4. **Meta**: The story itself mimics viral content—you can't stop thinking about it
5. **Visual**: Easy to imagine as actual YouTube content
6. **Timeless Yet Timely**: Classic ghost story updated for the digital age

## The Horror Elements

1. **The Unstoppable Video**: Can't be deleted, keeps re-uploading
2. **The Figure**: Gets closer each frame, looks at viewers
3. **The 3:33 AM Rule**: Watch at this time and see yourself
4. **The Algorithm**: Indifferent AI that only wants engagement
5. **The Spread**: Viewers become part of the horror
6. **The Immortality**: Chloe's content lives on, corrupted
7. **The Frozen Expression**: Her death face becomes a thumbnail
8. **The View Count**: Never stops climbing

This story works because it takes something familiar (YouTube, viral videos, clickbait) and twists it into something sinister. It's horror that feels possible, which makes it even more unsettling.
