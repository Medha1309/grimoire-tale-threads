## Quotable Passages

Great examples for testing quote saving:

1. "The ventilation hummed with a rhythm that felt too measured, like it was trying to imitate breathing but hadn't quite mastered the cadence."

2. "She even recorded the day she found a folder dated three years into the future, filled with maintenance reports for repairs that hadn't happened yet."

3. "Nothing in Westbridge was dangerous, exactly. Everything simply carried the faint signature of something else simmering behind it."

4. "Folklore said the lights were recognizing something in the passerby — guilt, perhaps, or potential, or the kind of loneliness that changes a person."
