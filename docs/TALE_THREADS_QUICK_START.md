# Tale Threads - Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

### ✅ Cursor Removed
The problematic custom cursor that was interfering with clicks and interactions has been completely removed. You now have normal cursor behavior throughout the Tale Threads page.

### ✅ GitHub-Style Vertical Layout
Projects now display in a clean, vertical list (like GitHub repositories) instead of a horizontal grid. This makes it easier to scan, more scalable, and works better on all screen sizes.

### ✅ Improved Project Cards
Each project card now shows:
- Project icon with gradient background
- Clear title and author
- Full description (no truncation)
- Status badge (recruiting, active, finalizing, archived)
- Genre tag
- Collaborator count (e.g., "2/5")
- Last updated time
- Hover arrow indicator
