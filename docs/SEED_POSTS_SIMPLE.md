Title: The Symbolism of Mirrors in Gothic Literature

Content:
I've been fascinated by how mirrors are used in gothic horror. They're not just reflective surfaces—they're portals, truth-tellers, and sometimes prisons for the soul.

In "The Haunting of Hill House," mirrors distort reality. In "Carmilla," they reveal what shouldn't be seen. And in countless vampire tales, they expose the undead by showing nothing at all.

What are your favorite uses of mirrors in horror? Do you think they represent self-reflection, or something more sinister?

Title: Unreliable Narrators: When Can We Trust the Voice?

Content:
Just finished a story where I realized halfway through that the narrator had been lying to me the entire time. It made me question everything I'd read.

Unreliable narrators are brilliant when done well—they make you complicit in the deception. You WANT to believe them, even when the cracks start showing.

But there's a fine line between "clever twist" and "cheap trick." What makes an unreliable narrator work for you? And which stories have done it best?

Personally, I think the key is planting subtle clues that make sense in retrospect, without being obvious on first read.

Title: The Uncanny Valley of AI-Generated Horror

Content:
Has anyone else noticed how AI-generated images have this inherent creepiness? The slightly-wrong proportions, the dead eyes, the fingers that don't quite work...

It's like they exist in the uncanny valley—close enough to human to trigger recognition, but wrong enough to trigger revulsion. Perfect for horror, actually.

I've been thinking about incorporating this aesthetic into a story. Not about AI itself, but about something that LOOKS almost human but isn't. Something that mimics us but gets the details wrong.

The horror isn't in the monster being obviously monstrous—it's in the subtle wrongness that you can't quite put your finger on.

Thoughts? Is this a new frontier for horror, or just a passing trend?
