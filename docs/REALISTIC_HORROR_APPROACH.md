# Realistic Horror Approach - No Gimmicks

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Center Flickering

**Result:** Clean, atmospheric fog without distraction

### 2. Removed Gimmicky Scare

**Solution:**
- Completely removed the figure flash
- Replaced with simple 800ms fade from black
- No tricks, no surprises
- Just clean page transition

**Result:** Professional, atmospheric entry to Contact page
