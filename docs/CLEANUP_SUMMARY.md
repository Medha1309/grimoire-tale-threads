## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 🔴 Critical
- 3 security vulnerabilities (glob, esbuild, vite)
- 157 failing tests (37% failure rate)
- 25+ ESLint errors in production code

### 🟡 High Priority
- Large bundle size (2-3 MB)
- Heavy animations on low-end devices
- No error monitoring
- Missing error boundaries

### 🟢 Medium Priority
- Mobile not tested
- Accessibility not audited
- No E2E tests
- 50+ TypeScript `any` types

---

## ✅ What's Working Well
