# Dollhouse Image Placement

Save your generated haunted dollhouse image as:
**`dollhouse-haunted.png`**

in this directory (`public/assets/`)

## Image Requirements
- Format: PNG (with transparency if possible)
- Recommended size: 1200x1600px or similar 3:4 aspect ratio
- The image should show a Victorian haunted dollhouse with visible windows
- Dark, atmospheric background
- Windows should be clearly defined for door overlay positioning

Once placed, the Dollhouse page will use this as the realistic background.
